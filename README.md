<p dir="auto">This is an applications reading books</p>

The book reading application built in Next.js is a web-based platform designed to provide an immersive and user-friendly experience for reading books online. Leveraging the power of Next.js, a React framework for server-side rendering and routing, the application offers several notable features:

Responsive Design: The application ensures a seamless reading experience across various devices and screen sizes, making it accessible to users on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

Intuitive User Interface: The user interface is thoughtfully designed with a clean and intuitive layout. Users can easily navigate through the application, search for books, and manage their reading preferences.

Rich Book Collection: The application boasts an extensive collection of books spanning various genres, catering to a wide range of reading preferences and interests.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
